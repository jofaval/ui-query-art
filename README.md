## Motivation

I wanted to try out React Query; typesafety and async state-management library feels like magic. Specially compared to other alternatives.

## API

### Docs

### Artworks

## Run it!

Download the repo locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jofaval/ui-query-art.git
cd ui-query-art
```

And install all the necessary packages

```bash
pnpm install # or npm install or yarn install
```
